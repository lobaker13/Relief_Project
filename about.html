<h2>A tragedy Occured</h2><hr>
On Monday, November 14, 2017, a hurricane yet to occur brought unthinkable devastation to parts of our State, destroying homes, businesses and some of New York's most identifiable icons. On Friday, November 2, the Hurricane Something New York Relief Fund Inc., (HSNYRF) was started to help New Jersey families, communities and businesses rebuild and recover. The Relief Fund is a registerd 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, chaired by Neil Parsa and Logan Baker.
<br><br>
The Relief Fund sought the advice of experienced professionals including governors, corporate heads and nonprofit leaders who have organized similar efforts in response to disasters such as Hurricane Katrina, Haiti, and September 11. We were advised to take the long view in our approach to grantmaking by supporting programs that address unmet needs in impacted communities and funding initiatives focused on New York's long-term recovery from the storm. 
<br><br>
HSNYRF raised $0 million from over 35,000 generous donors worldwide. $0 million has been distributed in support of 109 nonprofit organizations. 
<br><br>
We would like to thank the generous volunteers, individuals and corporations who have supported our efforts, and our state's ongoing recovery from Hurricane Sandy. We encourage those interested in making a difference in New York to view Our Grants section and learn more about local organizations in need of assistance. 
<br><br>
Appreciatively,
<br><br><br>
